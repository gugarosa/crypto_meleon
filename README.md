## Usage

### Convert Colors

The only step is to perform a color conversion over the initial CryptoMeleon's image. To accomplish such a step, one needs to use the following script:

```Python
python convert_colors.py -h
```

*Note that `-h` invokes the script helper, which assists users in employing the appropriate parameters.*

### Generate Batch of CryptoMeleons

Additionally, it is possible to generate a batch of CryptoMeleons using random seeding and API color-requesting. To fulfill this purpose, just use the following script:

```Python
python generate_batch.py -h
```
